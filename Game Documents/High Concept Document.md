## Game Concept
Carrom Heroes is a turn-based, 2D, PvP game based on the classic game *Pocket Carrom*. Instead of Players use four of their *[[Pucks]]*, their characters, to battle with another player's pucks. The goal is to eliminate all enemies from the board by either bumping onto the enemy's pucks or using the skills of the player's pucks to deal damage.
## Setting
The game is set in the world of *[[Karromia]]*, a world of fantasy and magic, full of adventurers who roam the land searching for *[[Karrom Crystal]]*, which are believed to be the source of power which formed their very own world, and the source of magic.
### Regions
1. Meadows
2. Forest Caves
3. Spring's River
4. Lumberjack
5. Frozen Lake
## Mechanics
Before the game, the player may choose four heroes that they will take to battle. They can also pre-position their pucks on the board. A game starts with a coin toss to determine who moves first. Player 1 will use their chosen *[[Striker Puck]]* to break the group of pucks in the middle. Player 2 may position their puck freely anywhere on the board and use their turn after the break. In a turn, the striking player may use any one of their pucks to strike. Pucks can be eliminated when their HP runs out or if they encounter a hazard on the board. In the middle of the group lies a Karrom Crystal which gives buffs to the last puck to hit it when it's HP runs out. The game continues until only one player's puck/s remain on the table. The winner collects the Karrom Crystal as a trophy. In a situation where there is no puck remaining on the table, the match is considered as a draw and the crystal breaks.
